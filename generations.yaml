generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The original Ford Escape was a compact SUV developed in partnership with Mazda (which sold its version as the Tribute). Featuring traditional SUV styling with a boxy shape and upright stance, it combined car-like handling with light off-road capability. Built on the CD2 platform with unibody construction, it was available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 2.0L four-cylinder and a 3.0L V6, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior was practical and durable, with good cargo space and folding rear seats. A hybrid variant introduced in 2004 was the first hybrid SUV available in North America. The first-generation Escape established the model as a popular choice in the growing compact SUV segment, appealing to customers seeking a practical, versatile vehicle with a traditional SUV appearance but better fuel economy and handling than larger, truck-based SUVs."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The second-generation Escape featured updated styling but maintained the boxy, traditional SUV appearance of its predecessor. Continuing on an evolved version of the CD2 platform, it offered refined powertrains including an updated 2.5L four-cylinder base engine and a more powerful 3.0L V6. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, including the introduction of Ford's SYNC system. Safety features were enhanced with standard electronic stability control and improved crash protection. The Escape Hybrid continued with improved efficiency and performance. This generation maintained the Escape's strong market position while adding refinement and technology, though it began to face increasing competition from more car-like crossover competitors."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The third-generation Escape represented a dramatic shift in design philosophy, adopting a sleeker, more car-like appearance aligned with Ford's kinetic design language. Built on the Global C platform shared with the Focus, it featured improved aerodynamics, reduced weight, and enhanced handling. Engine options evolved to focus on EcoBoost technology, including 1.5L and 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinders, with a 2.5L naturally aspirated engine for base models. The traditional hybrid was initially discontinued but returned mid-generation. The interior offered more technology features including an available SYNC with MyFord Touch system, while maintaining practical features like the versatile cargo area. This generation transformed the Escape from a traditional small SUV to a modern crossover, appealing to a broader audience seeking car-like dynamics with SUV practicality."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Escape features a further evolution toward a sleeker, more car-like crossover design. Built on Ford's C2 platform, it's lower and wider than its predecessor with improved aerodynamics. Powertrain options include a 1.5L EcoBoost three-cylinder, a 2.0L EcoBoost four-cylinder, a traditional hybrid, and a plug-in hybrid offering around 37 miles of electric-only range. The interior was completely redesigned with a more modern, minimalist approach featuring a floating touchscreen, digital instrument options, and improved materials. Technology advanced significantly with available features including a head-up display, SYNC 4, and Ford Co-Pilot360 driver assistance suite. A modest refresh for 2023 updated the styling with a wider grille and larger touchscreen options. The fourth-generation Escape balances the needs of crossover buyers seeking efficient, technology-rich transportation with available electrification options, positioned alongside the more adventure-oriented Bronco Sport which shares its platform."
