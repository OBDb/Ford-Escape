## Generations

The Ford Escape has gone through four main generations since its introduction:

- **First Generation (2001-2007)**: The first Ford Escape was introduced as a compact SUV jointly developed with Mazda. It featured a unibody design with independent suspension and was available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 2.0L inline-four and a 3.0L V6. A hybrid version was introduced in 2004, making it the first hybrid SUV on the market.

- **Second Generation (2008-2012)**: The second generation received a redesigned exterior and interior while maintaining the same platform. Engine options were similar to the first generation, but with improvements in power and efficiency. The hybrid model continued with enhanced technology. This generation had more refined handling and improved NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) characteristics.

- **Third Generation (2013-2019)**: The third generation Escape underwent a complete redesign, adopting Ford's global C-platform shared with the Focus. It featured a more modern, European-inspired design and replaced the boxy styling with a sleeker, more aerodynamic look. Engine options included a 1.6L and 2.0L EcoBoost turbocharged engines, plus a naturally aspirated 2.5L. The hybrid option was initially discontinued but returned in 2019.

- **Fourth Generation (2020-present)**: The current generation Escape features a completely redesigned exterior and interior with a more car-like appearance. It's available with a range of powertrains including a 1.5L EcoBoost, 2.0L EcoBoost, a traditional hybrid, and a plug-in hybrid option. This generation offers improved fuel efficiency, more interior space, and enhanced technology features including Ford's SYNC 4 infotainment system and Co-Pilot360 driver assistance package.
