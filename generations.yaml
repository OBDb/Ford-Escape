generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The original Ford Escape was a compact SUV developed in partnership with Mazda (which sold its version as the Tribute). Featuring traditional SUV styling with a boxy shape and upright stance, it combined car-like handling with light off-road capability. Built on the CD2 platform with unibody construction, it was available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 2.0L four-cylinder and a 3.0L V6, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior was practical and durable, with good cargo space and folding rear seats. A hybrid variant introduced in 2004 was the first hybrid SUV available in North America. The first-generation Escape established the model as a popular choice in the growing compact SUV segment, appealing to customers seeking a practical, versatile vehicle with a traditional SUV appearance but better fuel economy and handling than larger, truck-based SUVs."

    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The second-generation Escape featured updated styling but maintained the boxy, traditional SUV appearance of its predecessor. Continuing on an evolved version of the CD2 platform, it offered refined powertrains including an updated 2.5L four-cylinder base engine and a more powerful 3.0L V6. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, including the introduction of Ford's SYNC system. Safety features were enhanced with standard electronic stability control and improved crash protection. The Escape Hybrid continued with improved efficiency and performance. This generation maintained the Escape's strong market position while adding refinement and technology, though it began to face increasing competition from more car-like crossover competitors."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The third-generation Escape represented a dramatic shift in design philosophy, adopting a sleeker, more car-like appearance aligned with Ford's kinetic design language. Built on the Ford C1 platform shared with the Ford Kuga, it featured improved aerodynamics, reduced weight, and enhanced handling. Engine options included a 2.5L naturally aspirated engine for base models and EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinders (1.6L and 2.0L). The interior offered technology features including MyFord Touch infotainment. This generation transformed the Escape from a traditional small SUV to a modern crossover, appealing to a broader audience seeking car-like dynamics with SUV practicality."

    description: "The 2017 refresh introduced a mid-cycle update with an Edge-inspired front fascia, reshaped LED taillights, and a new hexagonal grille design. The refresh also added SYNC 3 infotainment system with smartphone app connectivity (Sync Connect). The 1.6L EcoBoost was replaced by a new 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Interior refinements included reduced road and wind noise through improved insulation, acoustic glass, and enhanced seals. Driver-assist features became available including enhanced park assist, lane-keeping, forward collision warning, and adaptive cruise control. This facelift modernized the cabin and exterior styling while maintaining the same C1 platform and overall design language."

Built on the Ford C2 platform, it offers significantly improved interior space while being lighter than the previous generation. Powertrain options include a turbocharged 1.5L three-cylinder EcoBoost, a turbocharged 2.0L four-cylinder EcoBoost, and both a conventional hybrid and plug-in hybrid powered by a 2.5L Atkinson-cycle engine offering approximately 37 miles of electric-only range. The interior features modern design with SYNC 3 infotainment. The fourth generation marks the unification with the Ford Kuga outside North America under Ford's One Ford strategy."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (2023 Facelift)"

    description: "The 2023 refresh brought comprehensive updates announced in October 2022, featuring a restyled grille and headlights, updated taillights, and an optional front light bar. Both EcoBoost engines were reworked to meet current emissions standards while maintaining power output. The interior received a new digital gauge cluster as standard equipment, with an 8-inch screen and optional 12.3-inch LCD dashboard. Higher trim levels received a new 13.2-inch infotainment system with SYNC 4. The trim lineup was completely restructured, with S, SE, and Titanium replaced by Base, Active, and Platinum, plus three ST-Line variants. The plug-in hybrid became a standalone trim. Production ended in December 2025 as Ford discontinued the Escape to focus on electric vehicles and trucks."
