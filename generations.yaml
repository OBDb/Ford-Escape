generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The original Ford Escape was a compact SUV developed in partnership with Mazda (which sold its version as the Tribute). Featuring traditional SUV styling with a boxy shape and upright stance, it combined car-like handling with light off-road capability. Built on the CD2 platform with unibody construction, it was available with front-wheel or all-wheel drive. Engine options included a 2.0L four-cylinder and a 3.0L V6, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior was practical and durable, with good cargo space and folding rear seats. A hybrid variant introduced in 2004 was the first hybrid SUV available in North America. The first-generation Escape established the model as a popular choice in the growing compact SUV segment, appealing to customers seeking a practical, versatile vehicle with a traditional SUV appearance but better fuel economy and handling than larger, truck-based SUVs."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The second-generation Escape featured updated styling but maintained the boxy, traditional SUV appearance of its predecessor. Continuing on an evolved version of the CD2 platform, it offered refined powertrains including an updated 2.5L four-cylinder base engine and a more powerful 3.0L V6. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, including the introduction of Ford's SYNC system. Safety features were enhanced with standard electronic stability control and improved crash protection. The Escape Hybrid continued with improved efficiency and performance. This generation maintained the Escape's strong market position while adding refinement and technology, though it began to face increasing competition from more car-like crossover competitors."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The third-generation Escape represented a dramatic shift in design philosophy, adopting a sleeker, more car-like appearance aligned with Ford's kinetic design language. Built on the Ford C1 platform shared with the Ford Kuga, it featured improved aerodynamics, reduced weight, and enhanced handling. Engine options evolved to focus on EcoBoost technology, including 1.5L and 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinders, with a 2.5L naturally aspirated engine for base models. The traditional hybrid was initially discontinued but returned mid-generation. The interior offered more technology features including an available SYNC with MyFord Touch system, while maintaining practical features like the versatile cargo area. This generation transformed the Escape from a traditional small SUV to a modern crossover, appealing to a broader audience seeking car-like dynamics with SUV practicality."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: 2025
    description: "The fourth-generation Escape represents a major redesign introduced in 2020, featuring a more modern, sleek exterior with improved aerodynamics. Built on the Ford C2 platform, it offers significantly improved interior space while being lighter than the previous generation. Powertrain options include a turbocharged 1.5L three-cylinder EcoBoost, a turbocharged 2.0L four-cylinder EcoBoost, a hybrid with a 2.5L Atkinson-cycle engine, and a plug-in hybrid offering approximately 37 miles of electric-only range. The interior features a modern design with available SYNC 3 and SYNC 4 infotainment systems. A mid-cycle refresh in 2017 introduced updated styling with an Edge-inspired front fascia and improved technology. Production ended in December 2025 as Ford discontinues the Escape to focus on electric vehicles and trucks."
